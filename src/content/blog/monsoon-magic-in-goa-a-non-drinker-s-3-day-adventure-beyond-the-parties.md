# Monsoon Magic in Goa: A Non-Drinker's 3-Day Adventure Beyond the Parties

Goa in the monsoon? Many might warn against it, citing tricky weather and challenging commutes. But for those seeking a different kind of Goan experience—one filled with local flavors, serene landscapes, and thrilling casino nights, away from the typical party scene—the off-season can be an absolute charm. Here's a firsthand account of a memorable 3-day trip to Goa, embracing the monsoon's unique beauty.

## Day 1: South Goa Charm & Casino Thrills

Our adventure began bright and early, de-boarding at **Madgaon Railway Station** around 4:30 AM. Despite warnings, we opted for scooters, renting them on the spot from **Seby Car & Bike Rentals** for ₹800 (plus a ₹1000 deposit). A word of caution: while convenient, do thoroughly check the scooter's condition before renting, as ours had a few issues.

We then made our way to **Indismart Woodbourne Resort** in Nuvem, South Goa. This beautiful resort, offering individual villas for four people, was our perfect non-party haven. We paid around ₹10,000 for two nights, including an early check-in and complimentary breakfast. The morning was spent relaxing by the swimming pool, soaking in the resort's tranquil ambiance.

Later, we explored and shopped at the vibrant local **Madgaon Market**, getting a taste of authentic Goan life.

The evening brought an unexpected highlight: a casino night at **Deltin Jaqk** on the Mandovi River. For ₹2250 per head, we boarded the cruise at 6:30 PM and stayed until 2:00 AM, spending an additional ₹500 each on games. Having learned some games beforehand truly enhanced the experience, making it far more enjoyable than anticipated.

**Monsoon Travel Alert:** While the morning weather was pleasant, the evening commute to the casino was challenging. Raindrops felt like needles against the face on the scooter, so be prepared with rain gear and drive cautiously.

## Day 2: North Goa Exploration & Monsoon Moods

Day two greeted us with terrible weather, making the pool our primary activity for a good four hours. Our initial plan to visit the majestic **Dudhsagar Waterfalls** was thwarted, as the jeep rides were closed due to the monsoon. (A trek would have taken an entire day). Instead, we decided to venture north to experience a different side of Goa.

We explored **Baga Beach** and **Tito's Lane**, though, being non-drinkers, we skipped the bars and pubs. We had planned to catch the sunset at **Thalassa**, but the continuous rain meant no sunset views for us. After a brief exploration of North Goa, we headed back. Finding a beach shack for stags proved difficult, as the one open in Baga was exclusively for families.

### Day 2 Culinary Delights:

*   **Dados Goan Cafe**
    *   *Chonok Fish Thali*
    *   *Prawn Thali*
    *   *Kokam Soda*
    *   *Bangda Fish Fry*
*   **Fish Deck, Calangute** (Food was average, not recommended)
*   *Chicken Vindaloo*
*   *Kingfish Xacuti*
*   *Prawn Golden Fry*

## Day 3: Palolem's Serene Beauty & Trekking Rewards

The third day brought more rain and harsh weather. We started late, setting out for **Palolem Beach** hoping to catch a boat to **Butterfly Beach**. The drive to Palolem was incredibly scenic, offering beautiful hill station-like vibes.

Upon reaching Palolem, heavy rain prevented us from fully enjoying the beach, and boat rides were, again, closed. Undeterred, we decided to trek. We rode our scooter to the trekking trail and embarked on a 20-30 minute walk. The 40 km ride and the subsequent walk were absolutely worth it; the views were mesmerizingly beautiful.

After our trek, we returned to Madgaon, successfully returned our scooters (and received our full deposit back!), and indulged in some last-minute shopping at the market.

### Day 3 Culinary Delights:

*   **Cheeky Chilli, Palolem** (Highly recommended, every dish was excellent!)
    *   *Kingfish Thali*
    *   *Pad Thai*
    *   *Thukpa*
    *   *Goan Cashew Gravy*
    *   *Kokam Sarbet*
*   **Longuinhos, Madgaon**
    *   *Goan Mutton Sukka*
    *   *Japanese Fried Rice*
    *   *Lepo Ambotik Rice*
    *   *Cashew Fenny* (a small taste, split amongst us!)
    *   *Rum Balls*
    *   *Squid Masala Fry*
