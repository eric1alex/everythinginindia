Mumbai is a city that never sleeps and always eats. To help you navigate its bustling streets, vibrant food scene, and spiritual landmarks, we’ve polished this expert three-day itinerary. From the historic charm of South Mumbai to the legendary street food of the beaches, here is how to experience the "City of Dreams" like a local.

## Day 1: Spiritual Starts and Street Food Soul

**Morning: Blessings and Breakfast**
Begin your Mumbai journey at the iconic **Siddhivinayak Temple** in Prabhadevi. After your visit, take a cab to Matunga, the city's South Indian heartland. Head straight to **Cafe Madras** for a quintessential *South Indian brekkie*. Once you’re fueled up, take a leisurely stroll around the leafy lanes of **Matunga** to soak in the old-world atmosphere before heading back to your hotel to rest.

**Evening: The Chowpatty Trail**
As the sun begins to set, head to **Chowpatty** for a legendary street food trail. This is the place to indulge in Mumbai's most famous snacks.
*   **Must-Tries:** *Vada Pav, Bombay Sandwich, Pani Puri,* and *Frankie*.

After satisfying your street food cravings, explore the surrounding South Mumbai streets on foot. 

**Dinner: Refined Classics**

Kala Ghoda is perfect for wandering. Spend your afternoon visiting:
*   **Sassoon Library:** A stunning heritage structure.
*   **Jehangir Art Gallery:** The hub of Mumbai's contemporary art scene.
*   **Boutique Hopping:** Explore the local designer stores and stop by **Saancha Tea Shop** for a curated brew.

For a late lunch, you are spoiled for choice in this neighborhood. Consider **Burma Burma** (for incredible vegetarian Burmese), **Folk**, or **Hylo**.

**Evening: Marine Drive Magic**
As evening approaches, head to **Marine Drive** (the Queen’s Necklace). Pick up an ice cream from **Naturals**, find a spot on the promenade, and watch the city lights shimmer over the Arabian Sea.

## Day 3: Coastal Views and Culinary Masterpieces

**Morning: Temple Traditions**
Start your final day at the serene **Mahalaxmi Temple** overlooking the ocean. 

**Lunch: The "Udipi" vs. "Indulgent" Choice**
For lunch, you have two distinct paths:
1.  **The Local Way:** Drive about 20–25 minutes to **Classic** in Matunga. It is arguably the best Udipi-style restaurant in town. Their *Masala Pav* and *Pav Bhaji* are "to die for." (Alternatively, **Maji Sagar** or **Shiv Sagar** are great quintessential stops).
2.  **The Indulgent Way:** Visit **Gallops** at the **Mahalaxmi Race Course**. The setting is lush, and the meal is guaranteed to be an indulgent experience.

**Afternoon: Landmarks or Luxury**
Depending on your mood, choose your afternoon adventure:
*   **History & Views:** Visit **Babulnath Temple**, then head to the **Gateway of India**, the **Colaba Promenade**, and the **Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) Museum**.
*   **Shopping:** Head to **Palladium Mall** in Lower Parel for a high-end shopping spree.

**Dinner: The Grand Finale**
For your final meal, choose one of Mumbai's modern culinary gems: **Native Bombay**, **Bombay Brasserie**, or the highly recommended **The Bombay Canteen**. 
*   **Editor’s Choice:** At **The Bombay Canteen**, do not miss the *Sea Bass Sev Puri* and the *Eggs Kejriwal*.

**Late Night: The Farewell Drive**
Before you head to bed (or "nini"), take a long drive across the **Coastal Road** and the **Bandra-Worli Sea Link**. The midnight views of the skyline are the perfect way to say goodbye to the city.
